## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd cur-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Create a file named `cred.env` in the project root:
     ```env
     DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
     CHANNEL_ID=your-channel-id-here
     ```
   - Replace `your-bot-token-here` with your Discord bot token.
   - Replace `your-channel-id-here` with the ID of the text channel where reminders should be sent.

4. **Prepare your contests.json**
   - Example format:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "name": "Weekly Codeforces",
         "date": "2024-06-15T15:00:00+05:30",
         "link": "https://codeforces.com/contest/1234"
       },
       {
         "name": "LeetCode Weekly",
         "date": "2024-06-17T12:00:00+05:30",
         "link": "https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-123"
       }
     ]
     ```
   - The `date` field should be in ISO format with timezone (e.g., `2024-06-15T15:00:00+05:30`).
   - Update this file each week with your upcoming contests.

5. **Run the bot**
   ```sh
   node bot.js
   ```
   - The bot will read `contests.json` and schedule reminders for each contest.
   - If you update `contests.json`, restart the bot to reschedule reminders.
